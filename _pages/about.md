Hi, my name is Siddharth Nair and Iâ€™m a final-year Btech student in Electronics
and Communication at IIIT-Delhi.

I was a Research Intern at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/decoding-the-human-genome) in the
Life Sciences unit from May to July, 2020. Here I worked on analysing and implementing
various deep learning methods for b-cell epitope and antibody predictions along
with improvements to the existing methods.
