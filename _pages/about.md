Hi, my name is Siddharth Nair and Iâ€™m a final-year Bachelor student in Electronics 
and Communication at IIIT-Delhi.


I enjoy sinking myself into deep learning projects and writing useless but cool scripts :/.  
My interest areas are: machine/deep learning for object detection, protein sequence 
prediction and autonomous vehicles.
